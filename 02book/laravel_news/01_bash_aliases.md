    Bash aliases are shortcuts added to a file that allows you to reference another command through more memorable words, abbreviations, or characters. For example, if you use Git you may run git status many times throughout the day, so to save yourself time and keystrokes you could alias gs to git status and itâ€™ll automatically expand and call the proper command.
